          Before submitting your review to Ed-Cred, ensure it accurately
          reflects your feedback. All reviews are anonymous and final once
          submitted, and we cannot modify or delete them. If your review
          includes serious allegations (e.g., serious misconduct), you must
          provide supporting documentation; without it, the review cannot be
          published. Claims backed by official documentation will receive a
          "Verified Stamp" and be highlighted in bold. Use of profanity,
          offensive language, or inappropriate content will automatically result
          in the review being rejected and not published. Any uploaded documents
          will be securely stored for verification purposes only, not posted
          publicly, and will be transferred to an external hard drive for
          protection. By uploading documents, you grant Ed-Cred permission to
          view your name or your childâ€™s name solely for verification purposes.
          All other student names must be redacted to maintain confidentiality
