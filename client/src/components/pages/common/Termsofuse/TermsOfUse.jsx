        </li>
        <li>
          Any serious allegations, such as misconduct or violations, must be
          supported by official documentation. Reviews containing verified

          <br />
          By submitting documents that contain a student's name, you grant
          permission for Ed-Cred to view your child’s name solely for
          verification purposes. Ed-Cred will not use or display your child’s
