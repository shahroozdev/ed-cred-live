        Moderation and Review Process

        Ed-Cred will make reasonable efforts to moderate all incoming reviews,
        discussion posts, and forum contributions to ensure they comply with our
        guidelines. Due to the volume of reviews and posts, moderation may take
        up to one-two months. We rely on the community to report inappropriate
        content, which will be prioritized for review.
        <br />
        <br />
        Reviews about Ed-Cred internal team members, including the founder, are
        retained for internal purposes only and are not published publicly.

        Editorial Discretion and Platform Integrity
      </h2>
      <p className="text-[#686C70]">
        At Ed-Cred, our goal is to provide a platform that fosters honest,
        respectful, and constructive feedback. While we welcome a wide range of
        perspectives, we reserve the right to decline or remove any submission
        that we believe may undermine the integrity, safety, or mission of our
        platform. This includes, but is not limited to, reviews or posts that
        lack sufficient context, appear to be submitted in bad faith, or do not
        contribute meaningfully to the conversation.
        <br />
        <br />
        We apply this discretion carefully and thoughtfully, always with a
        commitment to fairness and the community we serve.
